## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Web Server:** XAMPP Server
- **Database:** MySQL

## System Modules
1. **User Module**
2. **Admin Module**
3. **Delivery Module**

The **User Module** caters to individuals willing to donate surplus food to mitigate food wastage. It facilitates the acceptance of food donations from users with excess food, such as restaurants and individuals. Users can register, log in, and donate food, specifying the type and quantity. The system matches donations with nearby needy individuals or organizations. Users can also view their donation history.

The **Admin Module** serves trusts, NGOs, and charities registered on the platform. It manages the food distribution process by receiving information about food donations from users and listing them for NGOs and charities to choose from. Admins can oversee and manage the list of donations, enabling NGOs and charities to select the food they require and request pickup through the Delivery Module. The Admin Module tracks requests and monitors which organizations receive which donations.

The **Delivery Person Module** is for individuals interested in participating in the food donation process by providing pickup and delivery services. Delivery personnel can register on the platform and offer pickup and drop-off services for NGOs and charities requesting food donations. The module displays the pickup and drop locations for the food donations.

The Food Donation Management System efficiently manages excess food, ensuring its distribution to those in need. The User Module accepts food donations, the Admin Module lists them for NGOs and charities to select from, and the Delivery Person Module provides pickup and drop-off services, reducing food waste and aiding those in need.
